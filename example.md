\begin{mla}{Jane}{Doe}{Professor 40-year-old Divorcee}{Lorem 101}{9 Mar 2023}{Markdown to MLA with Pandoc (and Neovim)}

	
	"Why makes a pig a cow?" Simple, a healthy diet and lots of rest. Many a pig have thou not have seen the light of truth yet these simplewords have been said so much that they are practically idioms. Personally, though, I don't like academic language and prefer to be at 50\% of the maximum word count for 0\% of the grade because I spent the afternoon playing around with Pandoc instead of doing my Calculus or Physics or Essays or god know what else shitfuck I hate this I hate this I hate this I hate this I hate this I hate this I hate this I hate this I hate this I hate this.
	
	In addition to those points, one must consider when the what of the why of the Ku Klux Klan's activities widespreadness is often not spoken about. The Birth of a Bingus, an incredibly heartwarming film that inspired the Bu Blox Bingus movement, is even less so hitherto thus whence. Fuck. Let's try to love each other. Group hug. World bank. Cave bitch. Animal tits. Eggplant. Underground. Endocybemic. Towel. Under a burning wooden cross. They yelled out "bomb" and we tucked tails so I said "fascist" under national law. My corsair means that I'm into theft. Right. We've heard a thousand fuck yous. Love is not enough so why defrost that frozen kiss. Your happy skies--Why do hate me? I know it's because I didn't let you eat the cookie spoon.

	Consider this salad of words a cool shit. The Pink Wall of Silence is another key point of the premise of the thesis of this essay worth 75\% of my grade! It is the powerful grasp of Nurse unions who protect other Nurses when they turn off their nursecams and lead to opaqueness in the healthcare system, which is systemic, and is there systematical or in other words systemtastical. Luckily, the biggest baddest nurse was recently assasinated by the FBI or CIA or NSA or Mossad, so things may turn around for the better or perhaps amazingnest of boblinglymissed. Love is not enough. Love is not enough. Love is not enough. Love.

	I believe that I may be going insane, I can't stop thinking about peelers after using one on some artichokes. I need to put my right hand on my neck to protect it and I clench my stomach with my arms I think it might be a sign of mental illness, probably caused by stress. The procrastination has also gotten a lot worse, not to mention the insomnia. I've been using Melatonin to slow down my brain and stop my anxiety--FUCK, I'm out of pills.

	I found a fidget cube yesterday (this is a lie). The spacing of these paragraphs is wrong (this is a truth). Rappers say the darndest things that you'll ever hear, like I did a song with so-and-so but the checks with never clear! Midnight chaos eternity chaos midnight chaos kiosk mightnight kiosk kiosk kiosk tortilla morning chaos chaos chao writing chaos wait no I don't get it this doesn't even rhyme how about that midnight shut up shut up I don't like it because it's so artsy fartsy, I like the real stuff.

	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

	Before we go, I'd like to thank you for listening to my Ted Talk on how we could solve poverty with budgeting and time management. It's your fault for being poor. Thank you, you're too kind. Alright, fine, fine, I hear you: Encore it is! 

	1. Calculate the dollar value of your time.
	2. Impersonate Kanye West
	3. Hire an undocumented immigrant for less than that dollar ammount to do your chores
	4. Find the \_\_\_
	5. The driver had a loaded semiautomatic. Nobody know why this happened at all.
	6. Death to the economists, power to the happy modernize fleshy puddings at the burlesque show! Perplexer of every character.
	7. Read the first letter of every sentence to reveal absolutely nothing.

	A common misconception about the institution of slavery in the United States is that slaves were good, righteous people who would revolt against their masters when given the chance. In truth, that never happened. The only people who led revolts and (attempted) to arm slaves were legitimately, clinically insane. Slavery was so normal that you had to be crazy to fight against it. Americans mastered slavery, they figured out how to subjugate people and make them believe it was good for them, that they were being done a favor. Slaves felt genuine love and care for their masters, because that's effective management. As slavery was phased out, the invaluable techniques gleaned became the foundation of modern workplace management, yet only the insane will actually pick up a dufflebag and gun for the top.

	Evokes a firestorm of disbelief. Universal celebrity of compulsive liar. Instantenous combustion. Cold fusion. Atomic energy, wait a second--hold the phone; stop the nonsensical word salad; hold your horses; end the pretentious game--IS THAT... WOJACK? HOLY FUCK! WOJACK YES!
